### Lora Fonts

#### by Olga Karpushina 
and Lora project authors

Lora is a well-balanced contemporary serif with roots in calligraphy. It is a text typeface with moderate contrast well suited for body text. A paragraph set in Lora will make a memorable appearance because of its brushed curves in contrast with driving serifs. The overall typographic voice of Lora perfectly conveys the mood of a modern-day story, or an art essay.

Technically Lora is optimised for screen appearance, and works equally well in print.

Designed by Olga Karpushina, and Alexei Vanyashin for Cyreal.
